# SmartStock--AI-
AI-Powered Inventory Early Warning System for Social Good
🌍 Problem Statement:
Many healthcare facilities, NGOs, and humanitarian organizations rely on manual or reactive inventory systems.
This often leads to:
• Stock shortages of essential supplies
• Delayed procurement decisions
• Wastage due to overstocking
• Increased risk during emergencies
Existing systems usually detect problems after shortages occur, rather than preventing them.
💡 Solution Overview: 
SmartStock AI is an AI-driven inventory monitoring and early warning system that uses real-time data processing and predictive logic to identify potential stock shortages before they happen.
# The system continuously analyzes inventory data and provides:
Early alerts for low-stock items
Visual risk indicators using heatmaps
Actionable reorder recommendations
This enables organizations to take proactive, data-driven decisions.
✨ Key Features
📊 Real-time inventory monitoring
🔄 Auto-refreshing calculations using Dynamic Tables
🌊 Change tracking with Snowflake Streams
🔥 Heatmap-based risk visualization
🚨 Early warning alerts for critical stock levels
📥 Exportable reorder lists for procurement teams
🏗️ System Architecture
The architecture is designed for scalability, automation, and real-time insights.
Flow:
Inventory data ingestion (CSV / Sheets / Databases)
Data storage and processing in Snowflake
Real-time updates using Streams
Automated calculations using Dynamic Tables
AI-based risk analysis
