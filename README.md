# SmartStock--AI-
AI-Powered Inventory Early Warning System for Social Good
🌍 Problem Statement:
Many healthcare facilities, NGOs, and humanitarian organizations rely on manual or reactive inventory systems.
This often leads to:
• Stock shortages of essential supplies
• Delayed procurement decisions
• Wastage due to overstocking
• Increased risk during emergencies
Existing systems usually detect problems after shortages occur, rather than preventing them.
💡 Solution Overview: 
SmartStock AI is an AI-driven inventory monitoring and early warning system that uses real-time data processing and predictive logic to identify potential stock shortages before they happen.
# The system continuously analyzes inventory data and provides:
• Early alerts for low-stock items
• Visual risk indicators using heatmaps
• Actionable reorder recommendations
This enables organizations to take proactive, data-driven decisions.

✨ Key Features
• 📊 Real-time inventory monitoring
• 🔄 Auto-refreshing calculations using Dynamic Tables
• 🌊 Change tracking with Snowflake Streams
• 🔥 Heatmap-based risk visualization
• 🚨 Early warning alerts for critical stock levels
• 📥 Exportable reorder lists for procurement teams
🏗️ System Architecture
The architecture is designed for scalability, automation, and real-time insights.

🤖 AI Component
The AI logic analyzes:
• Stock consumption trends
• Threshold limits
• Historical usage patterns
# Based on this analysis, it predicts:
• Risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
• Estimated time to stock-out
• Recommended reorder quantities

🎯 AI for Good Impact
SmartStock AI directly supports the AI for Good mission by:
• Reducing shortages of essential supplies
• Preventing resource wastage
• Supporting healthcare, NGOs, and disaster relief operations
• Improving operational efficiency in low-resource settings
This project demonstrates how AI can be applied ethically and responsibly for social impact.
